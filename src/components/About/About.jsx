          I am a Backend Developer with over {yearsOfExperience} years of hands-on experience specializing in Node.js.
          My expertise extends to developing scalable and efficient APIs, integrating third-party services,
          and implementing robust authentication mechanisms. I have a strong foundation in programming languages
          like JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, and I am skilled in working with databases such as PostgreSQL.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to my technical skills, I have experience with Docker for containerized applications
          and tools like Sequelize, Express, and Socket.io. My background in finance and data analysis gives me
          a unique perspective on solving complex backend challenges. I am proficient in agile methodologies such as Scrum
          and thrive in team-oriented environments where collaboration and delivering quality solutions are key.
          With a B2-level proficiency in English, I am capable of working in international settings.
          <br /><br />
          I am committed, detail-oriented, and goal-driven, always aiming to contribute to innovative projects
          while continuously improving my skills.
